            needed to make a website function and efficient. I didn't stop with
            the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
            Vue JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give
            you 100% web solution.

            They didn't offer me a job but I made myself as a remote web
            developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
            Hero.
